# Relevance Policy: California Housing Legislation

## Scope
We are interested in legislation and policy actions that **directly affect the rights, obligations, or costs of landlords and tenants** in the monitored California counties.

## Relevant Topics
- **Rent Control / Stabilization**: Changes to allowable rent increases, caps, or exemptions.
- **Eviction Protections (Just Cause)**: New requirements for eviction notices, relocation payments, or "just cause" definitions.
- **Registration & Fees**: Rental registries, inspection fees, business license taxes specific to rentals.
- **Fair Housing**: New protected classes or source-of-income discrimination rules.
- **Habitability Standards**: Changes to code enforcement or maintenance requirements.
- **Housing Supply (when relevant)**: Zoning changes that explicitly discuss "affordable housing overlays" or density bonuses (mostly relevant if they come with new inclusionary requirements).
- **Tenant Anti-Harassment**: Ordinances defining tenant harassment.

## NOT Relevant
- **General administrative items**: Approving meeting minutes, ceremonial proclamations, routine budget transfers (unless specific to a housing department).
- **Individual property disputes**: Specific zoning variance for one address (unless it sets a major precedent).
- **Purely homeless services**: Shelter operations, street outreach (unless it involves "master leasing" of private rentals).
- **Commercial real estate**: Legislation only affecting office or retail space.
