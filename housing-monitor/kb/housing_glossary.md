# California Housing Glossary

**Rent Control (Rent Stabilization)**: Local or state laws that limit the amount a landlord can increase the rent for a unit. In California, this is often governed by AB 1482 (Tenant Protection Act of 2019) or local municipal ordinances.

**Just Cause Eviction**: Protections that require a landlord to have a specific, valid reason (e.g., nonpayment of rent, lease violation, owner move-in) to evict a tenant.

**Source of Income Discrimination**: Illegal practice of refusing to rent to a tenant based on their source of income, including Section 8 vouchers (governed by SB 329).

**Fair Housing**: Laws that prohibit discrimination in selling or renting property based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.

**Ellis Act**: A state law that allows landlords to evict all tenants in a building if they intend to go out of the rental business.

**Inclusionary Housing**: Policies that require developers to include a certain percentage of affordable units in new market-rate construction projects.

**ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit)**: A secondary housing unit on a single-family residential lot. State laws have made it easier to build these to increase supply.

**RHNA (Regional Housing Needs Allocation)**: Using state projections to mandate how much housing each jurisdiction must plan for in its "General Plan" Housing Element.
